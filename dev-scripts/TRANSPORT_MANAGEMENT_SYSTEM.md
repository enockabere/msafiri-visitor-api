## 🎯 Business Logic

### Airport Pickup with Welcome Package Flow
1. **Admin Creates Booking**
   - Selects participants for airport pickup
   - System automatically checks for welcome packages
   - If packages exist, MSF Office added as first stop

2. **Booking Confirmation**
   - Driver receives multi-stop instructions
   - Route: MSF Office → Airport → Accommodation
   - Special instructions for package pickup

3. **Execution**
   - Driver goes to MSF Office first
   - Collects welcome packages (status: "package_collected")
   - Proceeds to airport for visitor pickup
   - Updates status to "visitor_picked_up"
   - Delivers to accommodation (status: "completed")

### Vendor Integration
- **Absolute Taxi API**: Automated booking with multi-stop support
- **Manual Vendors**: SMS/call coordination with status updates
- **Fallback**: If API fails, converts to manual booking

### Group Booking Logic
- **Accommodation-Based**: Groups participants by accommodation
- **Time-Based**: Groups by similar pickup times
- **Capacity Management**: Respects vehicle capacity limits
- **Cost Optimization**: Minimizes number of vehicles needed
